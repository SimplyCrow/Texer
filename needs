    |   Texer (Texture Manager)   |
    +-----------------------------+

 - Load a texture
 - Get a texture
 - Unload a texture after unreferenced
    - Different lifetime polices
    - Hot reload if needed
 - Remove a texture
 - namespaces for textures
    - like ui, enemies
    - groups that can be passed around as
      separate texture manager to reduce scope
 - extensive logging of loaded files and there states
 - dummy texture
    - dummy texture (maybe black) when not fully loaded
    - buffer swap if loaded
 - async loading/managing
